Nuclear volume correlated with cell volume across this range, maintaining a nuclear volume to cell volume (N/C) ratio of approximately 8% (Neumann and Nurse 2007). 
Gradual nuclear growth as cells grow during the cell cycle was also observed in HeLa cells (Maeshima et al. 2011).

The nuclear and cytoplasmic volumes of HeLa cells were 0.22 and 0.94 pl, respectively. Those of COS-7 were 0.14 and 2.4 pl, respectively.
