The main restrictions in terms of applicability of our methods are the requirements that enzymes cannot also be 
substrates and that the recharging mechanism for each modification should keep the concentration of donor 
molecules constant on the time scale of steady state formation. The latter requirement is widely believed
to hold for phosphorylation in which the donor molecule is ATP, and it has been taken for granted in all 
mathematical models of phosphorylation, but its validity for other forms of modification appears not to have 
been widelys tudied.
